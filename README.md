# AI-Powered 3D Website Using React

In this project, I have used the following:

ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring React website to life with animations

Loaded, created and customized stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as I understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
Made the code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
Added custom color and file support.
Generated and use images through DALLE AI
Downloaded the resulting t-shirt model image
Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve site's performance
